Ultimately for each review made, it will also be posted on the movies page along with the rating provided by the user and the name of the user.

, and possibly after MVP is implemented integrate database so other users can review

# Activity 2: Evaluating App Ideas
## Top Two
- Rotten Potatoes: Movie Review App
- Mark it Up: Note Taking App

---

### Evaluating the Ideas: Rotten Potatoes
- **Mobile**: *How uniquely mobile is the product experience?*
    - The user has the direct ability to select scroll, and modify their review with a touch, and swipe
- **Story**: How compelling is the story around this app once completed? 
    - the value is that the application provides the user with a log of movies they have both watched as well as their take on the movie experience(documentation of a memory)
- **Market**: *How large or unique is the market for this app?*
    - Everyone watches movies, granted the extense database, it is tailored to everyone.
    - App will provide value as it is can be a direct source of their movie experience history
- **Habit**: *How habit forming or addictive is this app?*
    - If I'm able to implement the slider effect for the rating I think it could have hi-appeal factor
- **Scope**: *How well-formed is the scope for this application?*
    - I think that integration with the API might be one of the more difficult aspects
    - I think a stripped-down version of this app is still interesting to build, especially the rating UI aspect
    - I feel as if now it's more manageable than what I expected.

### Evaluating the Ideas: Mark it Down
- **Mobile**: *How uniquely mobile is the product experience?*
    - seemless and would incorporate iCloud features saving files to the cloud
- **Market**: *How large or unique is the market for this app?*
    - quite unique as .md isn't as popular as notion, although lightweight and fast
- **Habit**: *How habit forming or addictive is this app?*
    - could be habit forming as it would cater to note takers and journalists.
- **Scope**: *How well-formed is the scope for this application?*
    - not very fleshed out and have never incorporated iCloud features into an application.


## Final Consideration
Provided with limited knowledge in working with iCloud and limited time-constraints I opted to go with **Rotten Potatoes** the Moview Review Application as it's something I can build off of and uses core components we've learned throughout this course.
